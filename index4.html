                <p>There are many ways a blog can give your ecommerce brand an added boost.For one, it gives you the opportunity to establish yourself as an industry expert and build brand authority over time.

                    More importantly, it's a highly effective tool for boosting ecommerce SEO (Search Engine Optimization). More unique, high-quality content on your ecommerce site will improve its indexing and ranking. Blogs are also a means for external and internal link building (as we will illustrate below).
                    While your product detail pages may already include SEO keywords, blogs give you the chance to incorporate other relevant search terms and address related queries. This helps to further cement your dominance within your niche.

                <li>Gift with purchase (or GWP in retail) is a promotion to attract customers and increase average order value. Retailers usually offer this in the form of a free item upon spending a certain amount. For example, “free skincare kit with any $100 purchase”.</li>
                <li>The free gifts with purchase are usually items that provide genuine and relevant values for the customers, such as travel-size bottles for cosmetics sales or a free mug that goes with the coffee or tea package.</li>
                <li>Retailers usually offer these promotions for a short time and with limited quantity. Labels such as “while supplies last” and “limited time offer” signal exclusivity and urgency, prompting the customers to take advantage of these offers as soon as possible.</li>
                <li>Discounts or markdowns lower the worth of your brand. They make your customers feel that your items aren’t as valuable as you originally promoted and they aren’t getting the best deals for their purchase. Frequent discounts are a race to the bottom and give your customers the incentive to avoid full price purchases and wait for the sales.</li>
                <li>Free gifts with purchase are normally only offered if the customer reaches a certain spending target. This means the customer’s more likely to buy more items to hit the minimum amount that makes them eligible for the promotion.</li>
